# NFT Hack Eth Global

## Creating digital art using real world materials.

### Short Description
ArtAlchemy is a platform where clients communicate a wish list to their favourite artist so that the artist knows what items and materials to make the next great piece from.
Mint your materials and instruct your artist to make your wishes come to life.

### Long Description
After arriving on the UI, the client can choose from several materials/colours/shapes called items. Once you chose your items, you will breed them to create a unique instruction NFT. Once this NFT is created the items used gets burned – clients can no longer choose those items for their artist until the artist releases them again on the platform. 
The NFT instruction is then sent to the artist who will start work on his project (e.g., sculpture or painting) using the chosen items. The artist signs the new piece physically with the specific JSON file – the address is in the artwork!
Once finished with the project the artist ships the physical piece to the client and the NFT gets merged once more – this time including all the digital copies, photos, 3D models etc on IFPS. Saved forever.
